These include, among others, ASC 718, ASC 505-15 and ASC 815. As a result, a significant part of this module is devoted to determining the appropriate accounting scope for the contract. Additionally, the ultimate accounting recommendation may depend upon certain elections available to the company, including the fair value option for financial instruments, the fair value option for hybrid financial instruments, and the potential availability of hedge accounting for a derivative. This module travels methodically through the accounting guidance to help you get to the right answer. You may refer to the Help, FAQ and Example content associated with each node for additional information to help you answer each question. If you become stuck on a question, please create a new Issue and reference the specific Node ID. We of course can't anticiapte every possible  situation when we write the content for each node; however, we will add content to address your situation, and likely someone elses, when appropriate."},
