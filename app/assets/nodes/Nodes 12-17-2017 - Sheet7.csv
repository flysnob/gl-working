These include, among others, ASC 718, ASC 505-15 and ASC 815. As a result, a significant part of this module is devoted to determining the appropriate accounting scope for the contract. Additionally, the ultimate accounting recommendation may depend upon certain elections available to the company, including the fair value option for financial instruments, the fair value option for hybrid financial instruments, and the potential availability of hedge accounting for a derivative. This module travels methodically through the accounting guidance to help you get to the right answer. You may refer to the Help, FAQ and Example content associated with each node for additional information to help you answer each question. If you become stuck on a question, please create a new Issue and reference the specific Node ID.

,,2,10-2,2,1,10,,q,"Are you analyzing the entire instrument (or two or more agreements as though they are a single instrument), or are you analyzing a feature or provision embedded within an agreement?",,Entire Agreement,10-3,Feature,11-1,,,,,,,,,,,,"The ASC Master Glossery defines a freestanding instrument as, ""A financial instrument that meets either of the following conditions: a) It is entered into separately and apart from any of the entity's other financial instruments or equity transactions; b) It is entered into in conjunction with some other transaction and is legally detachable and separately exercisable.""\n\nCertain sections of the ASC modify this general definition of a freestanding instrument by providing more descriptive language of the specific instruments or the specific terms of instruments that are within the scope of a particular section. For example, ASC 480, Liabilities - Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity states that its guidance applies to any freestanding instrument, including instruments that have ""...any of the following attributes: a) comprises more than one option or forward contract; b) Has characteristics of both a liability and equity and, in some circumstances, also has characteristics of an asset."" This kind of language does not redefine the meaning of freestanding instrument, but it does expand or narrow the scope of the freestanding instrument as it applies to a particular ASC section or subsection.\n\nSections of the ASC referenced within this analysis tool that, and any scope modifications that vary from the general definition of 'freestanding instrument' will be highlighted and analyzed where each section is cited.","1) Can an embedded feature be in a separate contract?\n\nYes. If the separate contract is referenced to and is dependent on another agreement or instrument, and has no substantive or economic value without the existence of the other contract that it references, then the separate contract is in fact merely a provision of the other contract. It could just as easily have been included in the other contract as a provision with no change in the substance of its terms.\n\n2) Can two freestanding instruments exist within a single contract?\n\nYes. This is effectively the opposite of question 1) above. If contractual terms within a single agreement can survive each other's termination or expiration, then the contractual terms could have been written as two separate freestanding agreements. The fact that they are included in a single agreement is immaterial. For accounting purposes, the contractual terms should therefore be analyzed as though they were two separate agreements.","The issue of whether you have a freestanding instrument or an embedded feature is one of scope.  Specifically, freestanding instruments are potentially subject to accounting standards that are not applicable to embedded features. For example, ASC 480, Liabilities - Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, applies only to freestanding instruments. Therefore a threshold requirement to further analysis is making this determination.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to make this determination is to look at the nature of an embedded feature.  An embedded feature is not something that can be sold or traded separately from the host contract...that is, the contract in which the rights and/or obligations of the feature are embedded. For example, a conversion option in a debt instrument does not have a separate existence without the debt instrument. If the debt instrument ceases to exist through repayment or expiration, the conversion option also ceases to exist. Also, contractually, a convertible debt agreement does not typically contemplate separation of the conversion option from the contract. This would require, instead, a new agreement between one party to the convertible debt agreement and a third party.\n\nThe ASC Master Glossery does not provide a definition of an 'embedded feature', yet the term is used liberally in certain sections of the ASC. As a practical matter, an 'embedded feature' is a contractual element of a freestanding instrument. An 'embedded feature', unlike a freestanding instrument, has no substantive existence without the freestanding instrument's existence. So, even though an embedded feature can be entered into as a separate contractual agreement, it is not entered into separately and and apart from any other instrument; rather, it will specifically reference the instrument to which it is contractually attached. So ask yourself this question, ""Does this agreement or contractual provision have the ability to stand on its own as if the host contract or any other agreement does not exist?"" If the answer is 'no', you have an embedded feature for accounting purposes.\n\nA freestanding instrument is just that, an instrument that stands on its own, that exists based on its own terms independent of the existence of some other instrument or agreement. So, look at the terms of you instrument and evaluate its terms. Does its terms provide for its existence regardless of any other instrument or agreement? If no, then your instrument is probably not freestanding and should be evaluated as a unit with the other instrument(s) or agreement(s) on which its existence is dependent. Going back to the conversion option above, it is not uncommon for a conversion option to be written as a separate agreement from the debt agreement. This can happen at inception of the debt agreement or at some point thereafter. Regardless, the conversion option, even though in a separate agreement, is in substance an embedded feature since its existence is dependent upon the existence of the debt agreement. Therefore, the debt agreement and the conversion option agreement should be combined and evaluated together as a freestanding agreement.\n\nDepending upon the accounting result determined for the combined instruments as a unit, you may still need to subsequently evaluate an embedded feature separately. But, this would only come after first evaluating the freestanding instrument. For example, if the freestanding instrument is determined to be a derivative reported at fair value, then there is no need to separately report the embedded feature. This analysis tool will tell you whether or not you need to evaluate embedded features based upon the analysis of the freestanding instrument. Evaluation of an equity-linked transaction is first performed to the freestanding instrument and then, and only under certain circumstances, must you then subsequently evaluate the freestanding instrument's embedded features.","Freestanding instruments and embedded features are often subject to the same accounting standards; however, the accounting result can be significantly different.","Freestanding instruments and embedded features are often subject to the same accounting standards.

This question applies to the lease as a freestanding agreement and should be answered 'yes' if you are analyzing a lease.

Such provision should be evaluated as a freestanding instrument separate and apart from the lease agreement.

An underlying may be a price or rate of an asset or liability but is not the asset or liability itself.""\n\nASC 815-10-15-93: Defines a notional as a quantity of some unit of measure, which can be currency units (dollars, pounds, euros, rubles, etc.), shares of stock, bushels, barrels or any other unit specified in the contract.\n\nThe settlement amount of a derivative is based on the interaction of the underlying with the notional. This interaction may be simple multiplication, or there may be a leverage factor or other constant(s). In the case of leverage or other constant factor, the actual notional amount is the stated notional amount as adjusted for such leverage or other constant factor.\n\nSee paragraphs 815-10-55-5 through 55-7 for related implementation guidance.","1) Does there have to be an underlying?\n\nYes. The underlying provides the variability needed for the agreement to be behave like a derivative. Variability is one of the key characteristics of a derivative. Without an underlying, there is no mechanism for triggering a change in the economic value of the contract to parties.\n\n2) Does there have to be a notional amount?\n\nNo. The notional merely serves as a factor in computing the settlement amount. The payment amount can, however, be a fixed amount or an amount determined without reference to a notional. The ASC definition states that there must be EITHER a notional OR a payment amount. If the contract has neither, then it does not meet the accounting definition of a derivative.\n\n3) Is the underlying always a market index or some other financial measurement?\n\nNo. The underlying can be anything that is observable or objectively verifiable. Market indexes, such as stock market averages, commodity prices and interest rates, are the most common form of underlying. However, if it can be observed or verified, it can be an underlying. The accounting standards mention credit ratings and credit indexes, insurance indexes, loss indexes, and climatic and geological conditions (earthquakes, hurricanes, snowfall, rainfall, etc.). An underlying can also be the occurrence of nonoccurrence of an event specified in the contract such as a scheduled payment, or contractual obligation or covenant. This last type of underlying is known as an 'on-off' switched and usually triggers a payment. The most common example of this is a loan default provision that triggers either a fixed payment (e.g., penalty) or an increase in contract interest rate. As you can see, the term underlying is used very broadly.","In a derivative instrument, the 'underlying' and the 'notional amount' combine to determine the settlement amount of the instrument, that is the amount that one party will have to pay the other party in cash, stock or other consideration. The underlying is generally a referenced rate, index or measurable event. The notional amount may be a number of units (bushels or pounds for example), a number shares, a specified fixed dollar amount or some other unit of measure specified in the instrument. Typically, the settlement amount is determined by simply multiplying the underlying by the notional amount. For example, in the cashless settlement of a warrant, the settlement amount is determined by multiplying the number of shares (the notional amount) by the difference between the stock price (the underlying) and the warrant strike price. In other cases, the settlement formula may be more complex and introduce leverage or other factors that affect the final settlement amount.\n\nAs an alternative to a notional amount, some instruments may provide for a payment provision that specifies a fixed or determinable settlement to be made if the underlying behaves in a certain way. For example, the instrument may specify that a $1,000,000 payment is to be made in the event that the price of gold increases by $200. In this case, the underlying (the price of gold) alone drives settlement of the contract since there is no notional amount; however, the requirements of ASC 815-10-15-93 are met since movement of the underlying acts as an on-off switch in determining whether or not the payment provision is triggered.",,You have eliminated several areas of GAAP as being not applicable to this freestanding instrument. The next step is to determine if the instrument meets the accounting definition of a derivative. There are three criteria that make up the definition. This is the first. The questions that follow will address the second and third criteria.,,

The purchase or investment amount allocated to each instrument is its initial net investment.","The Codification's definition of a derivative states that a derivative does not require an initial investment that is equal to the notional amount or that is determined by applying the notional amount to the underlying. Most derivative contracts require no investment at all, or require an initial investment that is less than that required to purchase asset or incur the liability related to the underlying to the contract. A warrant, for example, would not be purchased for the price a the underlying shares of stock. In this case, if the initial investment in the warrant is less than the underlying by more than a notional amount (less than 90 - 95% in practice) after adjusting for the time value of money, then ASC 815-10-15-96 is met. This evaluation is not usually difficult in the context of a single, freestanding instrument where you can look at the initial investment and evaluate that relative to the underlying. The analysis becomes more difficult when there are a number of instruments involved in a single transaction, in which case you will need to evaluate the portion allocated to the instrument your are evaluating. So, in the case of a capital raise involving debt and a detachable warrant, the initial investment in the warrant is the amount of the investment proceeds allocated to the warrant. The allocated proceeds should then be compared to the value of the underlying stock to determine if it is less by more than a notional amount. Another example is an interest rate swap contract which, depending on its terms, may have no value at inception or may have one part paying the other party an amount equal to the fair value of the contract at closing. Whatever the amount paid should be compared to the swap notional amount to determine if the initial investment is less by more than a notional amount.\n\nThe point in all of this is that a derivative contract typically exposes a party to the contract to the same (or similar) fluctuations as if the party had invested in an asset or incurred a liability related the underlying. Stock options, as adjusted for time value, are priced less than the the underlying stock yet expose the investor to similar market fluctuations in risk and value.",,This is the second of three questions to determine if the freestanding instrument meets the accounting defintion of a derivative.,,

,,17,13-12,12,1,13,Freestanding Derivative Definition,q,"Is there net settlement either by the terms of the contract, through a market mechanism or by delivery of a derivative instrument or asset that is readily convertible to cash?",,Yes,13-48,No,13-48,Analyze,13-13,,,,13-47,No,,,,,,"1) Does net settlement have to occur under the terms of the contract?\n\nNo. Net settlement can occur under the terms of the contract, through a market mechanism, or by delivery of a derivative or other asset that is readily convertible to cash. Net settlement simply means that the parties end up in a financial position that reflects their respective net gain or loss resulting from the contract. This criteria is intended to exclude contracts that require physical settlement where the physically delivered asset is not readily convertible to cash. Commodities, publicly traded stocks, publicly traded bonds, and other physical assets with active trading markets are typically readily convertible to cash and would therefore meet this criteria. There are notable exception, like a publicly traded stock whose trading volume is very thin thereby making conversion of the stock received in physical settlement of the contract NOT readily convertible to cash. See _____ for an in-depth analysis of net settlement.\n\n2) Can I assume physical or net settlement if my contract provides for both physical and net settlement?\n\nIf the contract provides for net settlement than this criteria is considered met, even if physical settlement is an alternative. These settlement terms are potentially revisited if the instrument is determined to be a derivative (i.e., if all three criteria are met).","Net settlement under the terms of the contract is met if neither party is required to deliver an asset that is associated with the underlying and that has a principal amount, stated amount, face\nvalue, number of shares, or other denomination that is equal to the notional amount (or the notional amount plus a premium or minus a discount). Net settlement may be made in cash or by delivery of any other asset, whether or not that asset is readily convertible to cash.\n\nNet settlement through a market mechanism is achieved if one of the parties to a contract is required to deliver\nan asset of the type described in ASC 815-10-15-100, but there is an established market mechanism that facilitates net settlement outside the contract. Many derivatives are traded on exchanges. Other qualifying market mechanisms include, among others, over-the-counter arrangements, and private transactions where there are multiple market participants will and able to enter into a transaction at market prices. Evaluation of the this criteria should be made at inception of the contract and throughout its life. If a market mechanism for net settlement disappears after the initial assessment, and there is no other means for achieving net settlement, then the net settlement criteria is not met and the instrument no longer meets the definition of a derivative.\n\nNet settlement through delivery of a derivative contract or asset that is readily convertible to cash is met if the ""readily convertible to cash"" criteria in the glossary to ASC 815 are met. The characteristics include: (1) interchangeable (fungible) units, and (2) quoted prices that are available in an active market, which can rapidly absorb the quantity held by an entity without significantly affecting the price. These characteristics often make thinly traded commodities and stocks unable to meet the criteria, even if the owner might be able to borrow using the assets as collateral. One way to evaluate this criteria is to estimate the amount of cash that would be received in a net settlement arrangement versus the amount of cash that would be received by converting the asset or derivative received to cash. If the difference is significant, say more than 10%, then the asset or derivative is probably not readily convertible to cash under this definition.",,This is the third and last of three questions to determine if the freestanding instrument meets the accounting definition of a derivative. Your responses to this question and the previous two will determine whether this instrument is then evaluated as a derivative or as a non-derivative financial instrument.,,

While these factors may also impact the operations of your company, a benchmark rate is not a measure that is determined solely by reference to your company's operations.","Determining whether an instrument is linked to the entity's own stock is a two part test. The first criterion (ASC 815-40-15-7A and 7B) looks at the exercise contingencies, if any, and evaluates their nature. If there are no exercise contingencies, then the first criterion is met. However, if there are one or more exercise contingencies, they must be based solely on either 1) the market for the entity's own stock (e.g., trading volume, closing price, average for a given time period) or 2) some observable index the is a measure solely by reference to the entity's own operations (e.g., net income, earnings per share, revenue). If the contingency is based on any other market (e.g., S&P 500) or observable index (e.g., rate of inflation, an interest rate benchmark), then this criterion is not met. Remember, this must be a contingency based solely on some measurement of the entity itself and no other outside factor or factors regardless of how minimal.\n\nThe ASC provides a list of example exercise contingencies that meet or do not meet the criterion. The can be found at ASC 815-40-___). Several of these are common exercise contingencies found in equity-linked agreements. Click Examples for a list of additional examples.",,An equity-linked instrument that meets the accounting definition of a derivative is subject to derivative accounting unless it is both indexed to the entity''s own stock and classified in equity.

However, there are a number of factors that go into determining fair value. Any terms built into the settlement provisions of the instrument that affect the settlement outcome that are not also inputs to determining fair value act as a poison pill and result in the criterion not being met. This has a significant impact since settlement provisions will frequently have terms that are designed to protect the holder from downside risks. One of the most frequent provisions of this type found in an equity-linked transaction is a so-called down-round price protection provision. This can carry a number of names including 'half-ratchet anti-dilution', 'full-ratchet anti-dilution' and many others. Regardless of the name, the intent is the same...to adjust the conversion price of the instrument in the event that the entity subsequently enters into a financing at a share price lower than that of the instrument being analyzed.\n\nDon't be fooled by the term 'anti-dilution'. True anti-dilution provisions are considered acceptable under this criterion. 'Anti-dilution' when used in the context of price protection is not anti-dilution at all and is a misuse of the term. True anti-dilution is designed to offset the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and similar events. They do not improve the instrument holder's financial or economic position. Price protection provisions, regardless of the name given, improve the instrument holder's position relative to other instruments lacking such a provision and are therefore not anti-dilutive as that term is traditionally used.\n\nOf all the issues related to derivative accounting, this issue has the most broad-based effect. Down-round price protection is very common in private equity financing. The price protection provisions find their way into convertible debt, convertible preferred stock, warrants and just about every other kind of instrument. These provisions violate the 'indexed to its own stock criteria' and cause the instrument to be subject to derivative accounting. This is so common, in fact, that we have provided a page that provides example language to be aware of as you analyze an instrument. There are any number of reasons why an instrument may be subject to derivative accounting. This is the most common.",,This is the second and last of two questions to determine if the freestanding agreement is indexed to the company''s own stock. Your response to this question and the previous question will determine whether the analysis should continue to determine if the instrument is classified in equity (because is IS indexed to the entity''s own stock) or should be classified as an asset or liability accounted for as a derivative instrument.,,

26,classified_in_equity,122,26-1,1,9,26,Classified in Equity,q,Does the contract require net cash settlement?,,Yes,26-18,No,26-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1) My instrument contains both net cash and physical settlement provisions. Should I answer this question 'yes'?\n\nNo. Definitely not. If there are any settlement alternatives other than net cash settlement, answer this question 'no'.","If the contract can only be settled under its terms by net cash settlement (i.e., one party pays the other party the net cash or loss realized from the contract), then asset or liability classification is required.  And, logically, equity classification is precluded.\n\nIf the contract provides for physical settlement or net share settlement, or the choice between either cash settlement or share settlement, then the answer to this question is 'no'.\n\nThis question should be answered 'yes' only if 1) net cash settlement is REQUIRED or 2) net cash settlement is REQUIRED upon occurrence of an event(s) and that event(s) is outside the control of the entity. In the case of #2, even if there are other settlement alternatives, the presence of this requirement taints the instrument since net cash settlement is not provided as an alternative. It should also be pointed out here that the probability of the event occurring is not relevant. Even if the probability is considered highly remote, the taint of equity classification is still present.\n\nThe determination of whether an event is outside the control of the entity can get tricky. Events that are clearly unrelated to the entity such as weather events, geological events and governmental approvals are obvious. The entity cannot control those outcomes. The entity may be able to influence a government decision, but that is far from having control. The tricky part arises when the event is controlled by shareholders or the board of directors, which is typically elected by the shareholders.\n\nSo where do you draw the line at defining 'entity'? This can quickly become a legal question. State law is the ultimate determinant of what control can be exercised by shareholders, what rights reside with the board of directors, where board responsibility falls with respect to shareholders, and so on. All states are different in their statutes and in their case law.\n\nIf you have a net cash settlement requirement upon a change of control, you really need to consult with an attorney to understand which party really controls a change of control. Shareholders often have the right to approve a sale without management and/or board consent. Shareholders are not necessarily the 'entity'. Particular attention should be paid the the control exercised by the counterparty to the contract through percentage ownership of shares and board positions allowed to be appointed.\n\nThere is one possible exception to this result. The question here is whether the entity could be forced to net cash settle the contract, regardless of how remote. This issue of shareholder control is made moot if, under the terms of the contract or by means of the entity's governing documents, or both, the shareholders would also receive net cash settlement of their stock. In other words, if the contract requires net cash settlement upon occurrence of the event and shareholders would also receive cash upon occurrence of the event, then equity classification is not precluded. Clear as mud? Sorry, this one is hard to explain. The basic premise is that if the counterparty to the contract and the holders of the shares underlying the contract are effectively treated the same upon occurrence of the event, then this net cash settlement requirement does not by itself taint the instrument's equity classification.",,"Based upon your responses to the previous two questions, this instrument is considered indexed to the entity''s own stock.

The ASC 815 guidance provides the example of a freestanding equity-linked agreement that provides the holder a fixed or guaranteed return such that the two instruments acting together behave like a debt instrument. In this case both agreements should be classified as liabilities regardless of any share-settled alternatives.\n\nThe ASC 815 guidance also provides the example of a detachable warrant that gives the holder the right to purchase shares at $75 and the right to put the warrant back to the company at $2,010 per share. The guidance requires liability classification of the warrant because of the significant difference in the economic value of the settlement alternatives (share settlement of the stock purchase option component versus cash settlement of the put component) and the effective guaranteed cash return afforded by the put. This warrant is in substance a debt instrument.",,"If the entity has the choice of net cash or share settlement, share settlement is presumed unless the economic value of share settlement is greater than that of cash settlement in which case the entity would presumably choose to avoid the uneconomic alternative.

,,130,26-9,9,9,26,Classified in Equity,q,Does the contract permit the entity to settle in unregistered shares?,,Yes,26-10,No,26-10,,,,,,26-17,No,,,,,,,"The company must be able to settle the embedded derivative feature in unregistered shares or equity classification is prohibited. As long as there has not been a failed registration that would prohibit issuance of unregistered shares, settling in unregistered shares is within the company’s control since issuance generally requires only the approval of its board of directors. A requirement to issue registered shares, on the other hand, is beyond the control of the company since approvals are generally required by both shareholders and regulatory entities (e.g., SEC, listing exchange, etc.). Obtaining such approvals is not assured. In this circumstance, ASC 815 assumes that the counterparty will force cash settlement if registered shares can not be delivered and there are no other share settlement alternatives provided for in the agreement.\n\nThe one exception to this assumption provided in ASC 815-40-25-16 is that if the contract requires only that the shares be registered as of inception of the instrument and there are no requirements for subsequent timely filings or registrations, then registered share settlement is considered to be within the control of the entity. In other words, if registered shares are available to satisfy settlement of the contract at inception, and if the contract does not impose any timely filing or other registration requirements on the entity, then delivery of registered shares is deemed to be within the control of the company.\n\nIf the contract provides for a penalty that is payable in the event that the company fails to deliver registered shares, such penalty may help mitigate the presumption of cash settlement.\n\nA penalty should be evaluated in two different ways.\n\nFirst, is the penalty in effect a cash settlement for failure to deliver registered shares? This can be disregarded if the contract provides for other settlement alternatives such that the “uneconomic” penalty can be avoided by using a different settlement alternative.\n\nSecond, is the penalty approximately equal to the difference in fair value between registered and unregistered shares? If so, the entity may presume settlement in unregistered shares and that payment of the penalty is to compensate the counterparty for the difference in fair value between registered and unregistered shares which is in effect a discount, not a penalty.",,"Your responses to the previous set of questions indicate that the contract will be share settled according to its terms or based upon the economic substance of the transaction.

All contracts that are potentially settled in shares must be evaluated and there must be sufficient authorized and unissued shares for all contracts or this criteria is not met. For example, if the entity has a warrant whose exercise price is variable based upon changes in fair value of the company’s stock, an outside index or some other variable, there is no means of determining how many shares will be required to satisfy the warrant. Since the number of shares can not be determined, there is therefore no way for the entity to determine whether it has sufficient authorized and unissued shares to satisfy the derivative instrument.\n\nThe entity must continuously evaluate this during the life of the instrument since new contracts entered into by the entity may taint the classification determination made at inception. Likewise, if there is no way to determine if there are sufficient authorized and unissued shares at inception, this may become possible during the term of the instrument as one or tainting instruments expire or are exercised.

If the holders of the warrant are the only parties net-cash settled, then equity classification is not permitted. If, however, holders of the underlying stock into which the warrant is convertible would also be net-cash settled upon a change of control, then this criterion is met. Entities should be mindful to consider whether an instrument that requires net-cash settlement under certain circumstances has two different settlement results.
